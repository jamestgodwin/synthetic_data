To download the files use the command:

`git clone https://github.com/jamestgodwin/synthetic_data.git`

### Objective
Comparing PCA, SMOTE and CTGAN for data generation to use for ML evaluation. 

### Evaluation 
Using logistic regression, random forests and a simple neural network to classify whether someone is normal or abnormal in terms of back pain. 

These models all used the default parameters and were trained on the synthetic data, and were evaluated with the raw data from below. 

### Dataset
Back pain: presence of back pain
